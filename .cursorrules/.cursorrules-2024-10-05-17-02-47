1. Use TypeScript for type safety. The project is configured for TypeScript with strict mode enabled.

2. Use single quotes for strings instead of double quotes. 

3. Export functions and components using the `export` keyword instead of `export default`.

4. Use camelCase for variable and function names.

5. Structure files based on features instead of types (e.g. group by pages instead of components vs utils).

6. Break code into small, focused modules and components. Avoid large, dense files.

7. Use JSX for markup in React components. Configure the JSX transform.

8. Make use of Hono's middleware for routing, validation, serialization etc instead of hand-rolled solutions.

9. Write tests for critical business logic. Consider unit vs integration testing.

10. Follow conventions from libraries like Hono for project structure, build process etc.
