Rules to follow:
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Ensure that TypeScript strict mode is enabled in the `tsconfig.json` file by setting `"strict": true`. This helps catch common errors and enforce best practices during development.
   
2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Use exact versions for dependencies in the `package.json` file to ensure reproducible builds. For example:
     ```json
     "dependencies": {
       "hono": "4.4.12"
     }
     ```
   - Consider using a lock file (e.g., `package-lock.json`) to lock dependency versions for consistent builds across different environments.

3. **Code Structure**:
   - Organize code into separate modules/files based on functionality. For example, the `getRandomInt` function is placed in a `helpers.ts` file for utility functions.
   - Follow a consistent naming convention for files and functions to improve code readability and maintainability.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks or middleware, to handle exceptions and prevent crashes in production environments.

5. **Build Process**:
   - Utilize the scripts defined in the `package.json` file (`dev` and `build`) for running and building the application. Ensure these scripts are properly configured to streamline the development and deployment process.

6. **Testing**:
   - Consider incorporating unit tests using frameworks like Jest or Mocha to ensure code reliability and facilitate future refactoring without introducing regressions.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Document important functions, modules, and APIs using JSDoc comments to improve code maintainability and facilitate collaboration among team members.

8. **Security**:
   - Implement security best practices, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks.

9. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile the application using tools like Chrome DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize critical code paths for better user experience.

10. **Version Control**:
    - Use a version control system like Git to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain a history of code modifications. Follow branching strategies like Gitflow for a structured workflow.
