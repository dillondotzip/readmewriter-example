### Code Style and Structure:
- Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces or 4 spaces) throughout the codebase.
- Prefer arrow functions over function expressions for concise code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance code readability.
- Group related functionality together to improve code maintainability.
- Avoid unnecessary comments that only restate the code.

### Naming Conventions:
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Prefix interfaces with an "I" (e.g., `interface IUser`).
- Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the entity.

### TypeScript Usage:
- Enable the `strict` compiler option to catch common errors at compile time.
- Utilize type annotations for function parameters and return types.
- Leverage interfaces to define complex data structures.
- Use enums for a set of related constants.
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var` for variable declarations.

### Syntax and Formatting:
- Use single quotes for string literals consistently.
- Prefer template literals (`) for string interpolation when possible.
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments to simplify code.
- Avoid unnecessary parentheses in arrow function parameters when there is only one parameter.
- Use semicolons at the end of statements for consistency.

### UI and Styling:
- If applicable, follow a consistent UI design system or component library.
- Separate UI logic from business logic for better maintainability.
- Utilize CSS preprocessors like SASS or LESS for styling if needed.
- Optimize images and assets for faster loading times.
- Implement responsive design principles for a better user experience.

### Performance Optimization:
- Minimize the use of unnecessary dependencies to reduce bundle size.
- Implement lazy loading for components or modules that are not immediately required.
- Use server-side rendering or static site generation for faster initial page loads.
- Optimize network requests by bundling API calls or using caching mechanisms.
- Profile and analyze performance using tools like Lighthouse or Chrome DevTools.

### Key Conventions:
- Follow a consistent file structure and naming convention across the project.
- Document code using JSDoc comments for better code understanding.
- Use version control effectively with clear commit messages and branching strategies.
- Write unit tests for critical functionality to ensure code reliability.
- Regularly refactor and optimize code to maintain code quality and performance.
