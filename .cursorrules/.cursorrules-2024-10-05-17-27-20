Here are some rules for adapting to this codebase:

Code Style
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Use single quotes for strings
- Export functions and components using default exports

Structure
- Group imports at the top of files
- Separate API route handlers into separate files/modules

Naming Conventions 
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Name files and directories using kebab-case

Syntax
- Explicitly define parameter and return types for functions
- Use async/await over promises for async logic
- Destructure objects and arrays over accessing properties

Formatting
- Use Prettier to auto-format code
- Limit line length to 80 characters
- Include empty lines between logical sections

Performance
- Avoid using lodash and opt for native methods
- Use Bun's built-in compression and caching
- Lazy load non-critical modules and components
