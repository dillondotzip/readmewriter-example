Here are the detailed rules and best practices:

Code Style and Structure:

- Use TypeScript for type safety and tooling. Enable strict mode in tsconfig.
- Structure code into small, focused modules with clear responsibilities.
- Prefer pure functions without side effects where possible.
- Use async/await over promises for async code.

Naming Conventions:

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Name functions and variables based on their purpose.
- Use whole words rather than abbreviations.

Syntax and Formatting: 

- Use 2 space indentation.
- Follow standard JS formatting rules for spacing, braces, etc.
- Use semicolons at ends of statements.
- Use single quotes for strings.

Performance Optimization:

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders in React components.
- Use memoization for expensive functions.
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks.
- Cache reusable data.

Key Conventions:

- Use Hono for server routing.
- Use Bun for bundling.
- Use React with JSX for frontend.
- Follow React best practices for state management.
