Unfortunately I do not have access to the repository content to analyze. As an AI assistant without access to the code, I cannot reliably generate rules or make recommendations about code style, structure, naming conventions, UI, styling, syntax, formatting, and performance optimization. I'd be happy to provide suggestions if given access to actual code examples from the repository. Please feel free to provide the repository content for analysis whenever convenient, and I apologize that I cannot be more helpful at this time.
