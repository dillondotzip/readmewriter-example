Unfortunately I do not have access to the repository content to analyze. As an AI assistant without access to the code, I cannot reliably generate rules or make recommendations about code style, structure, naming conventions, UI, styling, syntax, formatting, and performance optimization. I'd be happy to provide an analysis if you can share the repository contents with me or describe the code in more detail. Please let me know if you can provide access or additional details about the codebase - I'm happy to assist however I can.
