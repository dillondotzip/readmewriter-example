Main technologies/frameworks used:
- Hono - Fast and lightweight web framework for Node.js
- Bun - Ultra-fast JavaScript runtime
- TypeScript - Static typing for JavaScript
- React JSX - Declarative UI component model 

Code style/structure:
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Component file names are PascalCase
- Variable and function names are camelCase
- Indent using 2 spaces
- Export components and functions
- Destructure props in components
- Avoid giant components - break into reusable pieces
- Wrap components in React.memo for performance

Naming conventions:  
- Components are PascalCase
- Hooks start with 'use' prefix
- Constants are UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Event handlers are handle[Event] 
- Boolean props are is/has[Property]

UI/styling:
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Add aria-* attributes for accessibility 
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Extract inline styles to styled components

Syntax:
- Prefer arrow functions over function declarations
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation
- Always use === instead of ==

Formatting:  
- Use Prettier to auto-format code
- Maximum line length 100 characters
- Newline at end of files

Performance:
- Lazy load components with React.lazy 
- Use React.memo on functional components
- Virtualize long lists with react-window
- Prefetch data with SWR
