Some code style and structure rules in this codebase:

- Uses Hono web framework for route handling and responses
- Leverages Bun for bundling, dev server, and builds
- Implements TypeScript for type safety
- Exports a default Hono app instance
- Wraps route handlers in Hono's c.text() for text responses
- Extracts reusable helper functions like getRandomInt()
- Uses Arrow functions for concise handlers 
- Employs naming conventions like getRandomInt() and app constant
- Imports only what is needed, avoiding namespace imports
- Defines type for function parameters like getRandomInt
- Uses Airbnb style guide for formatting, spacing, and semicolons
- No unused imports or variables
- Configures JSX and React imports in TSConfig
- Sets up scripts for dev and build in package.json
