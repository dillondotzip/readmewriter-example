1. Code Style and Structure:
   - Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces or 4 spaces) throughout the codebase.
   - Prefer arrow functions over function expressions for concise code.
   - Organize imports with separate blocks for third-party imports, local imports, and internal module imports.
   - Utilize ES modules syntax for import/export statements.

2. Naming Conventions:
   - Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
   - Follow camelCase for naming variables and functions.
   - Use PascalCase for naming classes and React components.
   - Avoid abbreviations and single-letter variable names unless they are common conventions (e.g., 'i' for index in loops).

3. TypeScript Usage:
   - Enable strict mode in TypeScript compiler options to catch more errors at compile time.
   - Leverage type annotations for function parameters, return types, and variables where possible.
   - Use interfaces or types to define complex data structures and improve code readability.
   - Prefer TypeScript enums over plain JavaScript enums for type safety.

4. Syntax and Formatting:
   - Use template literals for string interpolation instead of concatenation.
   - Prefer object shorthand syntax for object literals.
   - Use destructuring assignment for objects and arrays to extract values into variables.
   - Avoid unnecessary ternary operators for simple conditional logic.

5. UI and Styling:
   - Follow a consistent UI component naming convention (e.g., Button, Header, Card).
   - Separate concerns by keeping styles in external CSS files or CSS-in-JS solutions.
   - Consider using a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS for enhanced styling capabilities.
   - Utilize CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for consistent UI design.

6. Performance Optimization:
   - Minimize unnecessary re-renders in React components by using memoization techniques like React.memo or useMemo.
   - Implement code splitting to reduce initial bundle size and improve loading performance.
   - Optimize network requests by bundling API calls or using caching mechanisms where applicable.
   - Profile and analyze performance using browser developer tools to identify bottlenecks.

7. Key Conventions:
   - Follow a consistent file structure and naming convention for better organization (e.g., components in a 'components' directory).
   - Document code using JSDoc comments for functions to improve code maintainability.
   - Use version control effectively with clear commit messages and branch naming conventions.
   - Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication and improve maintainability.
