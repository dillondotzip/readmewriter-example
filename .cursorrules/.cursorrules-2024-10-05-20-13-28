Here are the detailed rules and best practices:

Code Style and Structure:

- Use TypeScript for type safety and tooling
- Structure code into small, focused modules and components
- Prefer pure functions instead of classes when possible 
- Use async/await over promises for async logic
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

Naming Conventions:

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components, models, and types 
- Name files and exports after what they contain
- Name callbacks and handlers like onX or handleX

Syntax and Formatting:  

- Use 2 space indents, no tabs
- Put opening braces on same line 
- Use semicolons
- Prefer single quotes
- Maximum line length 100 chars

Performance Optimization:

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders in React components 
- Use memoization for expensive functions
- Lazy load non-critical modules
- Monitor and optimize build size 

Key Conventions:

- Follow Airbnb style guide
- Use Bun for bundling and builds
- Use Hono for server routing and rendering
- Use React JSX for frontend UI
