1. Use TypeScript for type safety. Add types for function parameters and returns.

2. Structure files by feature instead of by file type. Group together route handlers, models, controllers, etc.

3. Use camelCase for variable and function names.

4. Use descriptive names for variables and functions. Avoid single letters.

5. Format the code consistently with Prettier.

6. Use Hono's router for clean route definitions. Avoid complex nested route logic. 

7. Keep components simple and reusable. Extract reusable logic into custom hooks.

8. Use React's JSX for cleaner component markup.

9. Modularize code by features. Avoid large monolithic files. 

10. Add error handling for API and database calls.

11. Add logging for debugging issues and tracking metrics.

12. Follow separation of concerns. Put business logic in services, UI in components, etc.

13. Optimize images, use compression, lazy load when possible.

14. Use React.memo and useCallback for better performance.

15. Split code into environments for better dev/prod optimizations.
