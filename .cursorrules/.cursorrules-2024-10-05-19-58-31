Here are some recommended best practices for working with this code:

Code Style and Structure:
- Use TypeScript for type safety and tooling
- Structure code into small, single-purpose functions
- Prefer async/await over promises for async logic
- Use JSX for declarative UI code

Naming Conventions: 
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Name functions and variables based on their purpose

TypeScript Usage:
- Annotate function parameters and returns with types 
- Use interfaces and types for data models
- Enable strict mode for compile-time checks

Syntax and Formatting:  
- Use Prettier to auto-format code
- Favor single quotes for strings
- Use semicolons at ends of statements  

UI and Styling:
- Use CSS Modules for component-scoped styles
- Prefer styled-components over plain CSS
- Use UI library like Material UI for components

Performance Optimization:  
- Lazy load routes and components 
- Use memoization for expensive functions
- Check for unnecessary re-renders with React.memo

Key Conventions:
- Follow Hono conventions for routing and controllers
- Use bun for bundling and deployment
- Enable source maps for debugging
